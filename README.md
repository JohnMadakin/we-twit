## Setup

### Dependencies

- [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) - A JavaScript runtime environment
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - A web application framework for NodeJS
- [Mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) - A Document-based database management system
- [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - A promise-based ODM for NodeJS

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project in development mode

- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install and setup [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Clone the repository by running the command

  ```[bash]
  git clone https://github.com/JohnMadakin/we-twit.git
  ```

- Run `cd we-twit` to enter the application's directory
- Install the application's dependencies by running the command
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Create a `.env` file in the root of your directory using the `.env.example` file in the repository
- Setup the database(**_see [database setup](https://www.mongodb.com)_**)
- Start the application by running
  ```
  npm run start:dev
  ```
  The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:6000`

#### Database and ODM

- Create a database with `MongoDB Shell` and name it `we-twits`
- Set the following environment variables in `.env`:

  - `STAGING_DATABASE` - this is the database name
  - `STAGING_URL` - this is the database connection uri

- once you start the app, a database connection is setup and database created

### More about environmental variables

After setting up your `.env` from the template provided in the `.env.sample` file,
to use these variables anywhere in the app;

- import the `dotenv` package

```[js]
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
```

- Make it available for use as early as possible in that file

```[js]
dotenv.config()
```

- Access any variable in the `.env`

```[js]
process.env.MY_ENV_VARIABLE
```

## Testing

[Jest](https://jestjs.io) is used as the testing framework for both the unit tests.


```
  npm run test 
```

## Deployment

App is deployed on heroku
